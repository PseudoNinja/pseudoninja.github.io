        "description": "As an Application Development Leader (ADL), I steer the ship of day-to-day operations  playing the role of the Project Manager, Development Manager, and Scrum Master for two high performing fully-remote teams. The Performance Squad which focused on the calculation and presentation of trading performance data analysis to  include trending and historical indexes on both a scheduled or real-time basis. The Reporting Squad developed a tool that allowed our end users (traders and brokers) to drag and drop report components in a “word-like” environment to create and maintain their own reporting templates as needed.  The squad also managed numerous API endpoints to allow other teams in the organization to take advantage of the tools we developed to produce report products in alignment with their needs. My daily responsibilities included running squad times with each squad and tertiary support roles such as DBAs, DevOps, and Client Services. Serving as a Scrum Master (originally in Azure DevOps and later Jira) I was able to eliminate endless meeting cycles, allowing our engineers to focus on what they do best. Beyond squad times, I had resource management responsibilities for eight developers in various states of their careers to include quarterly reviews, hirings, terminations, and identifying training oppertunities. I organized weekly after-hours release verification, developed DataDog monitors, and wrote advanced ADO and JQL queries to develop real-time transparency for leadership. During my time there both teams saw a significant reduction in production bugs and increase in velocity to meet the growing needs.",
