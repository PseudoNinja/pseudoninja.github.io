# What I've Done

## Application Development Leader
_Orion: December 2021  - October 2023_

As an Application Development Leader (ADL), I steer the ship of day-to-day operations, playing the role of Project Manager and Scrum Master for a team while still having the technical skills to understand the challenges they face.

During my time at Orion, I was responsible for two distributed teams, eight direct reports from application development, and frequently managed contractors from overseas.

I led the Performance Squad, which focused on the calculation and presentation of trading performance data analysis, including trending and historical indexes on a scheduled or real-time basis. I utilized Azure DevOps and later Jira to manage daily team times.

The Reporting Squad developed a tool that allowed our end users (traders and investors) to drag and drop report components in a “word-like” environment to create and maintain their own reports as needed. The squad also managed numerous endpoints to allow other teams in the organization to take advantage of the tools we developed to produce report products in alignment with their needs.

My daily responsibilities included running team times with the team and tertiary support roles such as DBAs, DevOps, and Client Services. Serving as a Scrum Master (originally in Azure DevOps and later Jira) during this time, I was able to eliminate endless meeting cycles, allowing our developers to focus on what they do best.

Beyond team times, I had resource management responsibilities for eight developers in various states of their career, organized weekly after-hours release verification, developed DataDog monitors, and wrote advanced ADO and JQL queries to develop real-time transparency as to what my teams were doing and how they were performing.
